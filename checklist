Implement knn - done
Implement csv to feature-set and prediction data structure conversion for algorithms -data
Implement TF-IDF for converting textual featurs into numbers as features - done
Implement file write of feature, prediction, headers for fast input reading - done
Read from csv file and then pass to implemented knn. - done
Implement Metrics class, which takes in the classifier, train set and test set
and spits out metrics such as precision, confusion matrics, accuracy and recall

Adapt bagging implementation for knn

More feature engineering TBD:
1. Remove stop words
2. Regular expression tokenization instead of simple word tokenization
3. Word Stemming
