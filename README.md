**HOW TO RUN THE IMPLEMENTED APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS**

The file main.py is the main file from where all algorithms can be run. Simply uncomment/ comment the functions to see the results.
The various functions are:
* evaluate_knn()
* evaluate_bagged_knn()
* evaluate_svm()
* evaluate_naive_bayes()
* evaluate_logistic_regression()
* tune_knn_using_10_fold()
* tune_bagged_knn_using_10_fold()
* tune_svm_using_10_fold()
* tune_nb_using_10_fold()
* tune_lr_using_10_fold() 

Then, from the command prompt
```c
  python main.py
```

Similarly, the code to generate csv file from the xml data set can be found under amazon_set/

Then, from the command prompt invoke the following to run the program and generate the csv text based files.
```c
  python Main.py
```
